# hash-maps
### v 1.0.0
This repository contains two implementations of the hash map data structure.  One uses a linked list to resolve collisions and the other uses open addressing.  Both rely on a third file which provides some basic functionality.

To clone and use the data structures, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your computer.
